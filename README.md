# five-in-a-row - Lukas Edition!

Though it would first seem like it's your regular five-in-a-row game...
There is a twist! Computer cheats! 
Sometimes it places his mark on your color,
sometimes... It moves not only once. And then decides to win, if he makes 5 in-a-row.
But just Sometimes.

If computer cheats, don't be so weak, fight back!
You can place your marks onto his mark, but sadly one per your turn.
And if you manage to get 5 in a row, don't be so sure if you still have won.
Some computer does not accept your victory, and continues to move, and even might declare his own victory!

You must be very persuasive to actually win.
